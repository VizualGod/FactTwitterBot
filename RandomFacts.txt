Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals.
Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans.
Despite being solitary hunters, cats are a social species, and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well as cat pheromones, and types of cat-specific body language.
Cats have a rapid breeding rate. Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy.
Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, and the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.
A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BC, in West Asia.
Cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where humans live.
A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization.
A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed.
The world record for the largest cat is 21.3 kg (47 lb).
The smallest adult cat ever officially recorded weighed around 1.36 kg (3.0 lb).
Feral cats tend to be lighter as they have more limited access to food than house cats.
Cats average about 23-25 cm (9-10 in) in height and 46 cm (18.1 in) in head/body length (males being larger than females), with tails averaging 30 cm (11.8 in) in length.
Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads.
The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw.
Cats conserve heat by reducing the flow of blood to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouth.
Cats have minimal ability to sweat, with glands located primarily in their paw pads.
Cats pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures (but may also pant when stressed).
A cat's body temperature does not vary throughout the day; this is part of cats' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night.
Cats' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated, both of which are adaptations that allow cats to retain as much fluid as possible.
Cats' kidneys are so efficient that they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat, with no additional water, and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater.
In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein.
Since cats tend to eat all of their prey, they obtain minerals by digesting animal bones, and a diet composed only of meat may cause calcium deficiency.
A cat's gastrointestinal tract is adapted to meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels of several of the digestive enzymes that are needed to digest carbohydrates.
Cats do eat grass occasionally. Proposed explanations include that grass is a source of folic acid or dietary fiber.
Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.
Night vision is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.
Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils.
slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats.
At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.
Domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most non-primate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green.
Cat hearing is also extremely sensitive and is among the best of any mammal.
Domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules like carbohydrates, leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness.
While asleep, cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests that they are dreaming.
Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, cats do not have a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality and always hunt alone.
Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.
Feral cats are generally silent.
Even though cats and dogs are believed to be natural enemies, they can live together if correctly socialized.
It has even been theorized that the high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.
Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their coats.
Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming.
Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States killing an estimated 1.4–3.7 billion birds and 6.9–20.7 billion mammals annually.
Domestic cats select food based on its temperature, smell and texture, strongly disliking chilled foods and responding most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat.
Since cats cannot fully close their lips around something to create suction, they use a lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths.

The Disneyland location in Anaheim is the only theme park directly supervised and built by Walt Disney.
The idea for Disneyland came to Walt Disney after taking his daughters to Griffith Park in the 30’s and 40’s, and watching them on the merry-go-round.
The bench from Griffith Park where Walt Disney came up with the concept is on display in the park near entrance of Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln.
In order to gain further inspiration for his concept, he visited other parks such at Tivoli Gardens in Denmark, Efteling in the Netherlands, and Children’s Fairyland in the U.S.
Disneyland California Adventure was built on the site of the original Disneyland parking lot.
In 2013, Disneyland was the third most visited park in the world with about 16.2 million guests visiting.
